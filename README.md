# Customer Churn Prediction Assignment

## Overview
In this assignment, you will build and compare classification models to predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on features like age, tenure, monthly charges, and contract type. You will use Python, scikit-learn, and pandas to preprocess data, train three different models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest), and evaluate their performance.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the process of building and comparing classification models.
- Practice data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Write unit tests to validate your code.
